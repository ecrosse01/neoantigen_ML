# Predicting TCR‚ÄìNeoantigen Binders Using Machine Learning

---

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning (ML) to single-cell multi-omics data to **identify true TCR‚Äìneoantigen binding events** from a highly noisy background.

Using careful feature engineering and supervised learning (XGBoost classifier), the model amplifies true binding signals while suppressing background noise ‚Äî helping prioritize true TCR‚ÄìpMHC interactions for downstream validation.

**Problem**: Noisy dextramer binding data, weak or absent labels, high dimensionality  
**Goal**: Find true binder pairs with minimal ground truth available  
**Approach**: Self-supervised and supervised ML pipelines (Isolation Forest, XGBoost)

---

## Motivation

Identifying true TCR‚ÄìpMHC binding pairs is critical for neoantigen discovery and immunotherapy development.  
However, single-cell dextramer datasets are **noisy**, due to:

- Background dextramer "stickiness"
- Multiple dextramer signals per cell
- Sparse true binders among abundant noise

This project demonstrates how **machine learning + biological feature engineering** can dramatically **improve binder identification** in real-world noisy data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

- **Data Integration**:
  - Dextramer counts
  - CITE-Seq hashing
  - Gene expression
  - TCR sequencing

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Dextramer normalized fold-change (`dex_norm`)
  - Dextramer signal enrichment within Dex‚Å∫ cells (`dex_enrich`)
  - Dextramer rank and competition margin
  - Clonotype frequency and Dex‚Å∫ enrichment

- **Modeling**:
  - **Isolation Forest** (unsupervised anomaly detection)
  - **XGBoost** regression (predict `dex_norm`) ‚Äî self-supervised
  - **XGBoost** classifier trained on **validated binders** ‚Äî supervised

- **Interpretability**:
  - SHAP feature attribution analysis
  - Rank comparison against simple normalized signal ranking

---

## Key Results

- **Known true binders** (e.g., `SRSF2_31 ‚Üî clonotype16`) ranked **#1** by the trained model
- **8.9√ó score margin** between top hit and second-best under XGBoost model  
  (vs. **1.6√ó margin** using normalized dextramer signal alone)
- SHAP analysis shows **clonotype enrichment** and **dex_rank** as dominant predictive features
